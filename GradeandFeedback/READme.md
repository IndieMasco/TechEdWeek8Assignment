# You have done fantastically on this assignment Sam!

You have completed all the core requirements with clear skill and proficiency! Really showing your growth and adaptability! Keep it up!

# HTML (JSX)

Your JSX is nicely laid out and looks great to me. Good use of attributes and good use of javascript in your JSX using .map as well as conditional rendering!

Don't forget about the ability to pass props as well as making good use of semantics!

# CSS

Your styling is really satisfying and I unironically love your pickle theme! You have managed to really nicely style the page using 1 global.css file. I would look to expand your skills and flexibility in styling by trying css modules, separate style sheets and even tailwind. This will both help your skills but help you understand and develop other peoples projects where they might have a different process.

# Javascript/Next logic/Structure

Your logic is really nice and clear incorporating the new server components and utilising them really well! You successfully utilise revalidate and redirect after data is changed! Great use of params and great file structure.
One thing to keep in mind is the status of database queries currently you have some validation of SELECT queries, which is fantastic however for post and update queries you don't validate if they were successful before moving on, this is something to keep in mind.

# Suggestions

Consider user flow and over all website design. Keeping in mind what feels good to explore and what doesn't satisfy the user goals. You could approach this both in the planning stage and testing phase by making sure it flows and is fit for purpose.

### Stretch goal

Look into search bars to enable a user to search the questions. This is nice vanilla example which you can adapt for use with react/next
