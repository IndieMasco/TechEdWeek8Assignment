# Reflection

...

If there is anything you think I could do better or improve on, I'd be happy to listen and learn from what you have to say.

# Requirements

- 🎯 Display all posts on the page, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order.
- 🎯 Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
  - Please submit your database schema, as is mentioned in the submission instructions.
- 🎯 Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.
- 🎯 Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
- 🎯 Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. `/posts/:postid`).
- 🎯 Add a `redirect` when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.

# Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Implement a `select` input (or similar mechanism) that allows users to categorise posts during creation, storing them in their own table in the database. Ensure appropriate routing for categories, with endpoints such as `/categories` and `/categories/:id` to enable users to browse and interact with posts by category.
- 🏹 Create an edit functionality accessible via `/posts/:id/edit`, which pre-fills a form for post data. Create a working PUT route to update the post in the database.
- 🏹 Develop an edit comment feature accessible via `/posts/:id/comments/:id/edit`, which pre-fills a form for comment data. Create a working PUT route to update the comment in the database.
